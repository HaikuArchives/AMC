This is AMC - the A'dam Music Composer, version 1.14, for BeOS.
Last updated: july 1, 2005

If you found this README file, then you probably are in directory
	/boot/home/Downloads/amc

To compile and install AMC do the following:

- Open a Terminal in directory /boot/home/Downloads/amc/src
- Type:
		make
  Then, 3 MIME types will have been installed:
    "application/AMC-app"   (the program)
    "audio/AMC-tunes"       (the tunes, created by amc)
    "text/AMC-script"       (the scripts, created with a text editor)
- If this was succesful, type
		make install
  This will create soft links to the amc (the AMC executable) in:
    /boot/apps (so amc is in your PATH), and
    /boot/home/config/be/Applications (so amc is in your list of applications).
- Go to directory /boot/home/Downloads/amc/tunes, where the tune and script files
  are located.
- Type: amc dance.scr,
  or: double-click dance.scr,
  or: drag dance.scr to an amc icon.
  Then dance.sco and dance.scr will be loaded.
- For an introduction, go to directory /boot/home/Downloads/amc/doc/ and load
  amc-manual.html into your browser.

The following examples are provided:
   dance.sco, dance.scr			- as used in the manual
   rising.sco, rising.scr		- a small piece, full of dissonants
   lazy.sco, lazy.scr			- another piece, featuring heavy drums
   floating.sco, floating.scr	- as the title implies: featuring portando
   org-concerto.sco, org-concerto.scr - first part of Haendel's organ concerto opus 4, nr 4

The following C++ files form the program.
   str.cpp			- general string handling
   widgets.cpp		- widgets replacing the standard GUI components
   bitmaps.cpp		- icons
   sound.cpp		- everything to fill the audio buffer
   dump_wav.cpp		- WAVE file creation
   midi-out.cpp		- MIDI file creation
   read-wav-data.cpp- read wave files for the percussion instruments
   amc.cpp			- the main program
   chords.cpp		- the chords window
   ndist.cpp		- the note distances window
   edit-script.cpp	- edit or re-time the script-file
   set_attr.cpp		- replaces the usual 'xref' and 'mimeset' utilities.
					  If you move AMC to another location, then command
						 set_attr amc
					  will re-install the MIME types.
   amc-miniscm.cpp	- interface with MiniScheme
   usb/*.cpp		- USB interface with MIDI keyboard, used to create
					  library USBKit.a

Connecting a keyboard
  The USB interface has been taken from usbkit_99-03-23.tgz, which is
  a patch for BeOS 5.03. Only the files that are needed have been 
  incorporated in the AMC distribution.
  Each keyboard needs its own driver, and I need the real
  keyboard to write such a driver. The only supported keyboard by now
  is an M-AUDIO KEYSTATION 49e, which is an affordable 49-key USB MIDI
  controller. The so-called VendorID and ProductID are 2637 and 144
  restectively. If you have a different keyboard, then you might start
  AMC from a terminal. In this case MIDI messages that are NOT recognised
  will be written to the terminal. Then it should be easy to modify the
  numbers in file midi-keyb.cpp, and recompile.

Scripting with MiniScheme
  The files to build MiniScheme are provided in directory 'minischeme',
  however in the makefile first a test is done wether environment variable 
  MINISCHEME_HOME has been set. If not, then MiniScheme will not be compiled. 
  If it has been set in your .profile (pointing at the directory where the 
  MiniScheme files are located), then executable 'amc-miniscm' will be
  created, ready to interface with AMC. Please mail me for further
  instructions.
   
Creating MP3's
  In the manual is described how a WAVE file can be generated.
  Such a file can be converted to MP3 format with a suitable conversion
  program, for instance LAME, available from BeBits. Tip: installing
  LAME will generate several files and directories. Probably it is 
  useful to keep these at one place, e.g. /boot/home/lame/, which
  can be accomplished by the following commands:
     ./configure --prefix=/boot/home/lame
     make
     make install

  Then the following command will generate song.mp3:
     /boot/home/lame/bin/lame out.wav song.mp3

Composers
  If you managed to create a nice piece of music with AMC then please
  send it to me, because I'm curious.

Good luck!
